# About ArchKISS

The intention here is to create a dead simple and effective installer
for everyones favourite linux distribution, Arch, whilst also addressing 
afew configuration issues that are usually skipped by most users
or simply not present in other distribution all the while remaining 
true to the Arch principle of simplicity. 

<!-- This was inspired by the simplicity of the installation process of 
the raspberry pi project, [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net "Pi-hole project homepage").  -->

Please bare in mind 2 things: 
1. Although I have been/am/will be happy to help, this project comes with no guarantee whatsoever so proceed at your own risk! 
2. Appart from the aforementioned goals, my only motive here is to end up with as stable, smooth and stutter-free linux installtion as possible.

### nvidia only for now, I will update this soon
